This is still quite experimental. 

By default, all steps including searches and generated code should be written to a log file.

I think a better approach could be to break down all the functionality into functions and maintain a list of functions to call, which can be used in all subsequent generations of code.

Here are logs of attempts to run against the objective "Write a tetris game in Python!"

# Researching Tetris

# Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov.

# The objective of the game is to rotate and move falling pieces, called "tetrominoes", in order to create a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the gap.

# The game ends when the player is no longer able to fit the pieces onto the playing field.

# Typical programming for Tetris involves creating a game loop that handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the game.

# The game loop is typically written in a looping structure such as a while loop.

# The game loop will handle user input by reading the keyboard or mouse and updating the game state accordingly.

# The game state is typically stored in a two-dimensional array, with each element representing a block on the playing field.

# The game loop will also render the game by drawing the blocks on the playing field to the screen.

# Finally, the game loop will check for any lines that have been completed and remove them

# Researching the game Tetris

# Game Architecture

# Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov. The game is played by manipulating pieces composed of four square blocks, each of which has a different color. The pieces are called tetrominoes, and they fall from the top of the playing field to the bottom. The player must rotate and move the pieces as they fall in order to create and clear horizontal lines of blocks without gaps.

# Game Rules

# The goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of blocks. When a line is cleared, any blocks above it will fall down to fill the space. The player can rotate the pieces as they fall, and can move them left or right to try to fit them into the playing field. If the pieces reach the top of the playing field, the game is over.

# Typical Programming Approaches

# To program a game of Tetris, the programmer must create a game loop that updates the game state and renders the game graphics. The game loop should also handle user input, such as rotating and moving the pieces. The programmer must

# Researching Tetris

# Game Architecture

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game that was originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. The game consists of a playing field of 10 columns and 20 rows, and a set of seven different shaped pieces, called "tetrominoes". The objective of the game is to rotate and move the pieces so that they form complete lines across the playing field. When a line is completed, it is removed from the playing field and the player earns points.

# Game Rules

The game begins with a random selection of pieces that fall from the top of the playing field. The player must rotate and move the pieces so that they fit together and form complete lines. When a line is completed, it is removed from the playing field and the player earns points. The game ends when the pieces reach the top of the playing field and the player can no longer move them.

# Common Programming Approaches

Common programming approaches used to implement Tetris include using a two-dimensional array to represent the playing field, and using a loop to continuously generate new pieces. Additionally, collision detection algorithms are used to determine when pieces have been placed correctly and when
