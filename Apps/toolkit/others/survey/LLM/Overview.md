### 2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. While traditionally deployed in cloud environments, recent advancements have made it possible to run scaled-down versions of these models on edge devices. Examples include GPT-3, BERT, and their variants.

### 2.2 Small Language Models (SLMs)

Small Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a significant trend in AI, particularly for edge device deployment. The AI community is increasingly focusing on SLMs as a more efficient and practical alternative to LLMs for edge deployment.

Key characteristics of SLMs:

Performance of SLMs:
- Some SLMs, like Phi-3 mini, have shown impressive performance on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, sometimes approaching the performance of much larger models.
- Many SLMs can revert to the zero-shot inference level of the original FP16 model with just 5-shot assistance, demonstrating their efficiency in learning from limited examples.
- Specific performance metrics:
  - Phi-3 mini (128k context window):
    - Zero-shot: PIQA: 0.78, BoolQ: 0.82, Winograd: 0.70, ARC-E: 0.77, ARC-C: 0.49, WiC: 0.60
