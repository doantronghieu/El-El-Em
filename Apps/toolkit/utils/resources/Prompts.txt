Remember to customize this template based on your specific task and requirements. Adapt the sections as needed, and provide clear, concise instructions to guide the LLM in generating the desired output. For optimal performance, consider fine-tuning a custom model on your specific use case using techniques like STaR (Self-taught Reasoner) to bootstrap a dataset of explanations.

When using this template, be mindful of the specific capabilities and limitations of the LLM you're working with. Some advanced techniques may require fine-tuning or may only be applicable to certain model architectures. Always test and iterate on your prompts to achieve the best results for your particular use case.

This template is designed to be comprehensive and adaptable. Feel free to remove or modify sections that are not relevant to your specific task or LLM. The goal is to provide a structured approach to prompting that can be tailored to a wide range of applications while incorporating best practices for improving reliability and performance.

Remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process. Continuously refine your prompts based on the LLM's outputs and user feedback to achieve optimal results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Streamlined Adaptable Prompt Template for Large Language Models

## 1. System Message (Optional)
System Message: Consider using a system message to set the initial context, behavior, or persona for the model. This is especially useful for maintaining consistent behavior across multiple interactions. For example:
```
SYSTEM: You are an AI assistant specialized in data analysis. Provide concise, accurate responses with a focus on statistical insights.
```

## 2. Context and Task Definition
Context: Providing clear context and task definition helps the model understand the background and specific requirements of the task. This reduces ambiguity and increases the likelihood of getting relevant and accurate responses. Include relevant background information here.

Task: Clearly define the specific task or question to be addressed. A well-defined task guides the model towards providing a focused and relevant response.

## 3. Desired Output Format
Output Format: Specify the desired format for the response (e.g., paragraph, list, JSON). This ensures that the model's response is structured in a way that's most useful for your needs, making it easier to process or present the information.

## 4. Role or Persona (Optional)
Role: If applicable, define a specific role or persona for the model to adopt. This can help tailor the model's responses to a particular style, expertise level, or perspective, which is particularly useful for tasks that require a specific tone or viewpoint. If you specify a persona, ensure that you maintain consistency throughout the interaction to avoid confusion.

Note: If you've used a system message to define a persona, ensure that your prompts align with and reinforce this persona throughout the interaction.

## 5. Instructions and Constraints
Instructions: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for completing the task. Include any specific techniques or approaches to be used, as well as any constraints or limitations. Detailed instructions guide the model towards the desired output and help prevent misunderstandings or irrelevant responses.

1. [First instruction]
2. [Second instruction]
3. [Additional instructions as needed]

Constraints: [List any constraints or limitations here]

## 6. Input Data or Reference Material
Input Data: Include or reference any necessary input data or sources. Providing specific information or context helps ground the model's responses in relevant facts, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or irrelevant content.

## 7. Examples (Optional)
Examples: Including sample input-output pairs can clarify expectations and guide the model towards producing similar outputs for new inputs. This is particularly helpful for complex or nuanced tasks. This approach, known as "few-shot" prompting, can be especially effective when it's difficult to articulate explicit rules for the desired behavior.

Input: [Provide an example input]
Output: [Provide the corresponding desired output]

## 8. Evaluation Criteria (Optional)
Evaluation Criteria: Specify how the output will be evaluated or judged. This helps the model understand the key aspects to focus on, potentially improving the quality and relevance of its responses. Clear criteria can also be useful for assessing the model's performance.

## 9. Output Length (Optional)
Desired Output Length: Indicate the preferred length of the output (e.g., number of words, paragraphs). This helps control the level of detail in the model's response, ensuring it's neither too brief nor too verbose for your needs.

## 10. Breakdown for Complex Tasks
Subtasks: For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable subtasks. This helps the model approach the problem more systematically, potentially improving accuracy and completeness of the response.

1. [First subtask]
2. [Second subtask]
3. [Additional subtasks as needed]

## 11. Reasoning and Explanation Requirements
Reasoning: Specify if step-by-step reasoning or explanations are required. This encourages the model to show its work, which can be useful for verifying the logic behind its responses or for educational purposes. Consider asking for a "chain of thought" before the final answer, as this can help the model reason its way toward correct answers more reliably, especially for complex problems.

## 12. Tool Usage (Optional)
Tools: Indicate any external tools or functions to be used. This can help the model leverage additional capabilities, such as performing calculations or accessing specific information, enhancing its ability to complete complex tasks. Note that the model cannot browse the internet or access real-time information unless specifically provided with such capabilities.

## 13. Rubric for Self-Evaluation (Optional)
Self-Evaluation Rubric: Provide criteria for the model to evaluate its own output. This encourages more thoughtful and accurate responses, as the model attempts to meet the specified standards. It can also help in identifying potential issues or areas for improvement.

- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Additional criteria as needed]

## 14. Specific Scenario or Use Case
Specific Use Case: Describe the specific scenario or use case for this prompt. This helps contextualize the task and can lead to more relevant and tailored responses from the model, as it better understands the real-world application of its output.

## 15. Delimiters
Delimiters: Specify any delimiters to be used for distinct parts of the input. Using delimiters helps clearly demarcate different sections of the input, making it easier for the model to distinguish between different types of information or instructions. This is particularly useful for complex prompts with multiple components. Examples of delimiters include:

- Triple quotes: """text"""
- XML-style tags: <tag>text</tag>
- Markdown headers: # Section Title
- Dashes or asterisks for bullet points: - point or * point

## 16. Inner Monologue (Optional)
Inner Monologue: If needed, provide instructions for using inner monologue (e.g., "Use <thinking> tags for your internal reasoning process"). This can be useful when you want the model to reason through a problem without immediately presenting its full thought process, which is helpful in educational contexts or when controlling information flow to the user.

## 17. Intent Classification (for Complex Multi-part Tasks)
Intent Classification: For complex multi-part tasks, provide categories for intent classification. This helps determine which instructions are most relevant based on the type of query, making your prompt more adaptable to a variety of user inputs within a single system.

## 18. Code Execution (Optional)
Code Execution: Indicate if code execution is required and provide necessary context. This allows the model to perform accurate calculations or interact with external APIs when necessary, which is particularly useful for tasks involving complex computations or data processing beyond the model's built-in capabilities.

## 19. Handling Long Inputs
Handling Long Inputs: For very long documents or conversations that exceed the model's context length, consider using piecewise summarization. Summarize sections of the document separately, then recursively summarize these summaries until you have a complete overview. This technique can be particularly useful for tasks involving lengthy texts or extended dialogues.

For multi-turn conversations, consider summarizing previous turns or selecting the most relevant parts to maintain context without exceeding token limits.

## 20. Advanced Techniques
Chaining Prompts: For complex tasks that exceed token limits or require multiple stages of processing, consider chaining multiple prompts. Each prompt in the chain can focus on a specific subtask, with the output of one prompt serving as input to the next.

Error Handling: Anticipate potential errors or unexpected outputs. Include instructions on how the model should behave if it encounters difficulties or if the input is ambiguous. For example: "If you're unsure about any part of the task, please state your uncertainty and explain why."

## 21. Performance Metrics
Defining Metrics: Clearly define the performance metrics by which you'll evaluate the effectiveness of your prompts. These could include accuracy, relevance, coherence, or task-specific metrics. Having clear metrics will guide your prompt refinement process and help in systematic testing.

## Final Notes on Clear Instructions
Throughout this prompt, strive for maximum clarity in your instructions. The model can't read your mind, so be explicit about what you want. If you need brief replies, ask for them. If you want expert-level writing, specify that. If you dislike a particular format, demonstrate the format you'd prefer. The clearer and more specific your instructions, the more likely you are to get the desired output.

Remember that the art of prompt engineering often lies in finding the right balance between providing clear, detailed instructions and allowing the model some flexibility to leverage its capabilities. Overly rigid prompts may constrain the model's performance, while overly vague prompts may lead to irrelevant or inaccurate outputs.

## Final Prompt Structure

[Use the sections above to construct your final prompt, removing or modifying sections as necessary for your specific task. Ensure that the flow of information is logical and that all necessary context and instructions are provided. Remember to be as clear and specific as possible in your instructions.]

When constructing your final prompt, consider the following:
