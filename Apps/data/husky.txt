The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working dog breed that originated in northeastern Siberia, Russia. Known for their striking appearance, intelligence, and friendly demeanor, Huskies have become a popular choice as both working dogs and family pets.

## Appearance

### Coat
- The Siberian Husky has a double coat that consists of a dense, soft undercoat and a straight, coarse outer coat. 
- Common coat colors include black, gray, red, and agouti, often accompanied by distinct facial markings and masks.
- Their coat is designed to protect them from harsh Arctic conditions.
